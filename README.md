# Kaggle Completition: LLM Classification Finetunine

### Introduction
Finetune LLMs to Predict Human Preference using Chatbot Arena conversations.
In each user interaction a judge provides one or more prompts to two different large language models, and then indicates which of the models gave the more satisfactory response. 
Goal: The goal of the competition is to predict the preferences of the judges and determine the likelihood that a given prompt/response pair is selected as the winner.

In this competition, the challenge was to predict which responses users will prefer in a head-to-head battle between chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs). Using a dataset of conversations from the [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai), where different LLMs generated answers to user prompts.
